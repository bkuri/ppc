- Explain mode (`--explain`) for debugging
- Module listing (`--list`)

**Validation**
- `ppc doctor` for repository linting
- Strict mode (`--strict`) treating warnings as errors
- JSON output (`--json`) for machine parsing
- Graph visualization (`--graph`) for dependency analysis
- Statistics reporting (`--stats`)

**Configuration**
- `rules.yml` for exclusive group definitions

**Testing**
- Golden snapshot tests for output consistency
- Basic compilation tests
- Graph and ordering tests
- Integration tests with example repositories

**Documentation**
