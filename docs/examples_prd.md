# PPC Examples — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Purpose

The `examples/` directory exists to **teach PPC by demonstration**.

Rather than explaining concepts abstractly, examples provide:

- concrete, runnable prompt-policy repositories
- realistic use cases users already recognize
- increasing complexity through composition
- copy‑paste starting points (“shortcuts”) for real projects

Examples are not documentation.

They are **reference implementations**.

---

## Design Goals

Each example must:

- be complete and runnable
- compile successfully with `ppc doctor --strict`
- include a short README explaining *why* it exists
- demonstrate exactly one new conceptual idea
- build on concepts introduced earlier

Non‑goals:

- no artificial demos
- no toy prompts
- no placeholder text
- no fake complexity

Each example should feel like something a real team would actually use.

---

## Directory Structure

```
examples/
  01-basic-prompt/
  02-team-style-guide/
  03-knowledge-sharing-policy/
  04-product-prd-review/
  05-rag-governance-policy/
```

Each example is self‑contained.

```
example-name/
  README.md
  prompts/
  profiles/
  rules.yml
```

Users should be able to run:

```bash
ppc doctor
ppc explore --profile <profile>
```

from inside any example directory.

# Example 01 — Basic Prompt Composition

### Folder

```
01-basic-prompt/
```

### Concept Introduced

- PPC as a prompt compiler
- modules
- deterministic ordering

### Demonstrates

- `base`
- `modes/explore`
- simple traits
- markdown output contract

### README should explain

- why prompts drift
- how modules compose
- how output is deterministic

### Expected modules

- base
- modes/explore
- traits/creative
- traits/conservative
- contracts/markdown

### Key takeaway

> "This is what PPC replaces: one giant prompt file."

---

# Example 02 — Team Style Guide Policy

### Folder

```
02-team-style-guide/
```

### Concept Introduced

- organization‑wide behavioral policy

### Demonstrates

- tone enforcement
- formatting standards
- output rules
- exclusive tag groups

### New ideas

- `tone:*` exclusive group
- company voice enforcement

### Example modules

- traits/terse
- traits/verbose
- policies/style-guide
- policies/formatting

### Profiles

```yaml
profiles/default.yml
profiles/verbose.yml
```

### Key takeaway

> "PPC can enforce team-wide communication standards."

---

# Example 03 — Knowledge Sharing Policy

### Folder

```
03-knowledge-sharing-policy/
```

### Concept Introduced

- conversational governance
- requirements traceability

### Demonstrates

- contracts as process definition
- conversation period enforcement
- PRD/RAG evidence

### Core modules

- contracts/knowledge-sharing
- policies/conversation-period
- policies/requirements-evidence
- policies/rag-citations

### Profiles

```yaml
profiles/knowledge-sharing.yml
```

### README focus

Explain:

- why conversations need structure
- how PPC standardizes review discussions
- how CI can gate artifact presence

### Key takeaway

> "PPC can encode organizational process — not just prompt text."

---

# Example 04 — Product PRD Review Flow

### Folder

```
04-product-prd-review/
```

### Concept Introduced

- multi-stage review
- artifact-driven development

### Demonstrates

- PRD review contract
- acceptance criteria
- non-goals enforcement
- revision budgeting

### Example modules

- contracts/prd-review
- policies/acceptance-criteria
- policies/non-goals
- policies/risk-assessment

### Profiles

```yaml
profiles/explore.yml
profiles/ship.yml
```

### README focus

- treating PRDs as first-class artifacts
- preventing scope creep
- separating exploration from approval

### Key takeaway

> "PPC can formalize how products are designed, not just how prompts are written."

---

# Example 05 — RAG Governance Policy (Advanced)

### Folder

```
05-rag-governance-policy/
```

### Concept Introduced

- high-risk knowledge systems
- auditability
n### Demonstrates

- mandatory citation policy
- hallucination containment
- retrieval transparency
- escalation rules

### Example modules

- contracts/rag-governance
- policies/source-ranking
- policies/citation-format
- policies/failure-escalation

### Profiles

```yaml
profiles/internal.yml
profiles/client-facing.yml
```

### Advanced concepts

- multiple contracts
- shared policies
- exclusive audience groups

### README focus

- why RAG needs governance
- legal/compliance alignment
- audit-ready AI behavior

### Key takeaway

> "PPC can define AI governance policies suitable for regulated environments."

## Complexity Ramp

| Example | Complexity | New Concept |
|------|------|------|
| 01 | ⭐ | Composition |
| 02 | ⭐⭐ | Policy enforcement |
| 03 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Process governance |
| 04 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Product workflows |
| 05 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Enterprise AI governance |

Each example assumes mastery of the previous one.

---

## Documentation Rules

Each example README must include:

1. **Problem statement**
2. **Why PPC helps**
3. **Folder layout**
4. **How to run it**
5. **What to copy into your own repo**

No README should exceed ~2 pages.

---

## Success Criteria

The examples folder succeeds if:

- users recognize their own problems immediately
- examples are frequently copied verbatim
- most onboarding questions are answered by pointing to one example
- PPC’s purpose becomes obvious without reading the code

---

## North Star

Examples should make users say:

> "Oh — this is exactly what we’ve been trying to do."

If that reaction doesn’t happen, the example doesn’t belong here.
