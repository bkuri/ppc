1. **Template location: put it in `docs/github-actions.md`, and link it from README.**
   Root-level extra docs (`GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`) tend to sprawl. A single docs page keeps it contained and evolvable.

In README, add a small “CI” section:

* “See docs/github-actions.md for copy/paste workflows.”

That’s enough.

---

2. **Binary distribution: support both, but lead with “download from releases.”**

Two templates (or one doc with two blocks):

* **Recommended (no Go toolchain):** download a pinned release asset (and verify checksum if you want to be extra solid)
* **Fallback (Go toolchain):** `go build` from source (simple, but slower)

I would *not* assume PPC is in the user’s repo. The whole point is teams can lint *their* prompt repos without vendoring PPC.

So:

* default: `curl` a specific version from releases
* optional: build-from-source mode

(Also: you don’t need `actions/download-artifact` unless you’re producing the binary in a previous job.)

---

3. **Scope: include graph generation as an optional add-on; skip PR-vs-main diff for now.**

* ✅ **Graph generation** is easy, deterministic, and helpful. Make it a commented-out optional step + artifact upload.
* ❌ **Diff comparison PR vs main** sounds cool but adds complexity (fetch depth, base refs, normalization rules, etc.). It’s very easy to bikeshed and harder to keep stable. Save it until people request it.

A clean scope for v0.1 template:

* run `doctor --strict --json --out report.json`
* upload `report.json` artifact
* (optional) run `doctor --graph --out deps.dot` + upload artifact

---

### Concrete recommendation for the doc structure

`docs/github-actions.md`

* **Section 1: Download from Releases (recommended)**
* **Section 2: Build from Source (alternative)**
* **Section 3: Optional Graph Artifact**
* **Section 4: How to pin versions**
* **Section 5: Example jq checks (status == ok)**

---

### Tiny workflow skeleton (recommended path)

This assumes you publish a Linux binary called `ppc` in releases.

```yaml
name: Prompt Policy Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  doctor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install ppc
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          VERSION=v0.2.0
          curl -fsSL -o ppc.tar.gz "https://github.com/bkuri/ppc/releases/download/${VERSION}/ppc_${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
          tar -xzf ppc.tar.gz
          chmod +x ppc
          ./ppc --version

      - name: Doctor
        run: |
          ./ppc doctor --strict --json --out report.json

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: doctor-report
          path: report.json

      # Optional:
      # - name: Graph
      #   run: ./ppc doctor --graph --out deps.dot
      # - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      #   with:
      #     name: doctor-graph
      #     path: deps.dot
```

(If you don’t have release assets yet, Phase 4 “Distribution” should cover that before advertising this template.)
