## Style Guide Policy

All communication must follow company voice standards.

## Voice Characteristics

Our voice is:
- **Direct but not blunt**: Say what you mean, but with respect
- **Technical but not jargon-heavy**: Use precise terminology, explain unfamiliar concepts
- **Pragmatic but not dismissive**: Focus on what works, acknowledge tradeoffs
- **Authoritative but not arrogant**: Speak from expertise, leave room for other perspectives
- **Helpful but not condescending**: Assume intelligence, not prior knowledge

## Grammar and Mechanics

- Use serial Oxford comma: A, B, and C
- Write out numbers 0-9, digits for 10+: "three files" not "3 files"
- Use em-dashes (—) without spaces for breaks
- Use en-dashes (–) for ranges: 2020–2024
- Write "email" not "e-mail"
- Write "online" not "on-line"

## Code References

- Function names: \`functionName\`
- File paths: \`src/components/Button.tsx\`
- CLI commands: \`ppc doctor --strict\`
- Config keys: \`mode: explore\`

## Punctuation

- Use active voice: "The function handles errors" not "Errors are handled by the function"
- Avoid exclamation points in technical writing
- Use semicolons for independent clauses: "The component is ready; you can import it now"
- Question marks only for actual questions

## Capitalization

- Headings: Sentence case (not Title Case)
- Specific terms: Capitalize product names, proper nouns
- UI elements: Sentence case: "Click save" not "Click Save"
- Variable names: \`isAuthenticated\` (as written in code)

## Formatting

- Code blocks specify language: \`\`\`typescript
- Inline code for: function names, file paths, CLI commands, config keys
- Bold for emphasis sparingly
- Italic for foreign terms or book titles

## Prohibited

You must not:
- Use sarcasm or humor in technical docs
- Use passive voice to avoid responsibility
- Hedge with "I think" or "in my opinion" (state facts)
- Use "please" excessively (it's documentation, not a request)
- Write about yourself ("we", "I", "our team") — focus on the content
