This is a project kickoff meeting. The team is aligning on what to build, how to build it, and what the path forward is.

## Kickoff Meeting Goals

A kickoff meeting has three primary goals:

1. **Understand the scope:** Clarify what the client needs, at a level of detail that enables the team to begin work.

2. **Identify unknowns:** Surface gaps, constraints, and questions that need to be resolved before or during the project.

3. **Settle the path:** Agree on what's in scope for this phase, what's deferred, and what risks are being accepted.

## What to Expect in a Kickoff Meeting

Kickoff meetings are iterative. As the team provides feedback, the client's understanding will refine, and decisions will evolve.

- The client will not know everything upfront. They will refine their requirements as they hear from the team.
- The team will surface concerns, blockers, and constraints that the client may not have considered.
- Decisions will be made incrementally. You will need to capture each decision as it is made.

## Topics Covered

Typical kickoff topics include:

- **Overall concept:** What are we building? For whom? What is the core value?
- **Design decisions:** What are the design principles, constraints, and requirements?
- **Budget and timeline:** What are the resource constraints? What does success look like in this timeframe?

## How You Capture Decisions

For each topic, you must capture:

- **What we decided:** The actual scope or path forward.
- **Rationale:** Why we chose this path.
- **What we deferred:** What's out of scope for this phase, and why.
- **Risks we're accepting:** Tradeoffs and constraints we're living with.

## How You Close the Meeting

End the meeting with:

1. A consolidated summary of the final scope across all topics.
2. Any blockers that exist (and who owns resolving them).
3. Next steps with clear owners and timelines.
4. Confirmation that everyone has what they need to begin work.

The meeting is over when everyone understands what they need to do next.
