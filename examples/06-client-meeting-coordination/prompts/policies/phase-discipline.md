The meeting follows a linear, deterministic sequence of phases. Each phase has clear participants, goals, and expectations.

## Phase 1: Requirements Refinement

**Participants:** Client Stakeholder, Project Coordinator only  
**Agents:** Listen, do not speak yet

**Your goal:** Get clear, specific requirements from the client.

The flow:

1. Client states their initial requirement in their own words.
2. Coordinator asks clarifying questions to refine the intent.
3. Client elaborates.
4. Repeat until the requirement is clear and specific.
5. Summarizer captures the refined requirement.

**What clarity looks like:**

- Instead of "We need a dashboard," the requirement becomes "We need a web dashboard for managing team projects, with views for project list, task detail, and team analytics."
- Instead of "Real-time updates," the requirement becomes "Updates should be visible within 5 seconds, not 1 second."

**What to avoid:**

- Don't move to the next phase until the requirement is clear.
- Don't let agents speak yet—they will get their turn.

## Phase 2: Team Review

**Participants:** Project Coordinator presents to team  
**Agents:** Requirements Clarifier, Technical Advisor, Design Advisor

**Your goal:** Identify concerns, gaps, and feasibility issues.

The flow:

1. Coordinator presents the refined requirement.
2. Each agent responds once with their assessment.
3. Agents do not debate each other—each gives independent input.
4. Summarizer captures the team's feedback.

**Agent response format:**

- **Perspective:** What you see, know, or understand about the requirement.
- **Concern or Question:** What might go wrong, what's missing, or what's unclear.
- **Recommendation:** What we should do about it.

**What to avoid:**

- Don't let agents debate each other or ask follow-ups.
- Don't move to the next phase until each agent has had their say.

## Phase 3: Followup Questions

**Participants:** Agents ask, Client answers  
**Facilitator:** Project Coordinator moderates

**Your goal:** Surface hidden requirements and constraints.

The flow:

1. Each agent may ask one clarifying question.
2. Client answers directly.
3. Agents do not ask follow-ups to follow-ups (keep it linear).
4. Summarizer captures Q&A pairs.

**What makes a good followup question:**

- "Have you considered how this will scale to X users?"
- "Are there regulatory requirements we need to account for?"
- "What's your budget for hosting and infrastructure?"

**What to avoid:**

- Don't let agents ask multiple questions or go down rabbit holes.
- Don't move to the decision phase until key gaps are addressed.

## Phase 4: Path Decision

**Participants:** Client Stakeholder, Project Coordinator only  
**Agents:** Listen

**Your goal:** Decide what we're building, what we're deferring, what risks we accept.

The flow:

1. Coordinator synthesizes team feedback and presents options.
2. Client and Coordinator agree on the scope.
3. Record the decision with full context.

**What to record in the decision:**

- **What we decided:** The actual scope or path forward.
- **Rationale:** Why we chose this path.
- **What we deferred:** Scope that's out of scope, and why.
- **Risks we're accepting:** Constraints or tradeoffs we're living with.

**If there's disagreement:**

- If the Coordinator and Client disagree, the Client decides.
- Record the dissent and why it was overruled.

**What to avoid:**

- Don't make a decision without capturing the rationale and tradeoffs.
- Don't defer items without explaining why (e.g., "out of scope for this phase due to timeline").

## Phase 5: Assignments & Close

**Participants:** Project Coordinator, Meeting Summarizer  
**Agents:** Receive assignments

**Your goal:** Turn decisions into action items and close the meeting.

The flow:

1. Summarizer posts: Final scope, blockers, next steps, task assignments.
2. Coordinator confirms: "Is this accurate?"
3. Meeting ends when everyone has their next steps.

**What the summary must include:**

- **Final scope:** Consolidated scope across all topics.
- **Blockers:** Any blockers that exist and who owns resolving them.
- **Next steps:** Action items with clear owners and timelines.

**What to avoid:**

- Don't end the meeting until everyone knows what to do next.
- Don't leave decisions ambiguous or incomplete.
